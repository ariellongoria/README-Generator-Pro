# README Generator Pro

## Description

This project will help you make your own professional READMEs within minutes. Simply run the program and follow the prompts.

---

## Installation

Download the files, make sure you have node.js installed, and run `npm install` to download the dependencies.

## Usage

-   Run `node index.js` from the terminal and wait for the prompts.

-   Answer the prompts by filling in the title of your project and the other sections.

-   For some of the sections an external editor is used instead of the terminal to allow for more complex markdown to be generated (notepad on Windows).

-   Once you are finished writing the markdown, you must save the file and exit out of it. This will place the markdown inside the file. Otherwise, the markdown will not display inside the README.

-   Pick a license by using the arrow keys and Enter. If you do not have a license, pick `None`.

-   Enter your GitHub username and E-Mail for other users to contact you.

-   Check the readmes folder to find your new README.
