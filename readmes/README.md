## Installation

To install the packages simply use `npm install` and wait for the packages to download.

## Usage

Click on the buttons and see what it does.

There are a couple of types of buttons: 

* Red Buttons
* Blue Buttons
* Green Buttons
* Yellow Buttons

They all do the same thing, but they look pretty anyway.

## Contributing

In order to contribute to this project you have to adhere to a particular style of coding that only I know and that I am not going to explain in detail.

In short:

* You type things
* If I think it looks nice it stays
* Otherwise, I'm deleting your code :)

## Tests

I did not make any tests. I only code perfection.
